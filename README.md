Machine Learning with Python

In this project I have used one of the most popular data set in the Machine Learning Community the ""Iris Data Set"

This code is just to play around with one of the most popular algorithms like KNN and SVC.

And the important thing is, here some part of the codes were hard-coded for those who are going to learn Python as a beginner

Thank You !!!
